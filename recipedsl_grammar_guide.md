# RecipeDSL Grammar Guide

## Overview
RecipeDSL is a domain-specific language for defining recipe pages with structured information including instructions, ingredients, header information, and nutritional data.

The grammar was first generated by Xtext, then customized to make it easier to use. Generally the syntax is based on the ecore model this way:
- Capital first letter for contained classes
- Lowercase first letter for attributes

These modifications were done to costumize the generated grammar:
- Only use classname instead of relation-name + classname in the definition of an element. e.g. in `Page` you now just write `Instructions`, instead of `instructions Instructions`.
- Make the order of the contained classes of a parent class not matter. e.g. the order of which you put `Instructions` and `Ingredients` in the `Page` element relative to each other doesn't matter.

#### General consideration:
The attribute `orderNumber` could well have been changed with a syntactic rule, but the orderNumber attribute made code-generation easier.

## Basic Structure
A RecipeDSL file consists of a single `Page` element that contains four main sections:
- Instructions
- Ingredients
- Header
- Nutrients (optional)

The `orderNumber` attribute controls in which order sections appear on screen.

## Syntax Guide

### 1. Page Definition
Every RecipeDSL file must start with a Page definition:

```
Page {
    // content
}
```

### 2. Instructions Section
Instructions section is mandatory and requires an order number.

```
Instructions {
    orderNumber 2
}
```

### 3. Ingredients Section
Ingredients section is mandatory and includes:
- Required: orderNumber
- Optional: UnitOfMeasureToggle

```
Ingredients {
    orderNumber 1
    UnitOfMeasureToggle    // optional
}
```

### 4. Header Section
Header section is mandatory and contains:
- Required: BasicInformation
- Required: Title
- Optional: Image

```
Header {
    BasicInformation
    Title
    Image    // optional
}
```

### 5. Nutrients Section (Optional)
The nutrients section is optional and can include:
- Required: orderNumber
- Optional: PercentageAmountToggle
- Optional: Vitamins
- Optional: Macronutrients

```
Nutrients {
    orderNumber 3
    PercentageAmountToggle
    Vitamins {
        vitamin {
            VITAMIN_A, VITAMIN_B12, VITAMIN_C
        }
    }
    Macronutrients
}
```

### Vitamins
Available vitamin options:
- VITAMIN_A
- VITAMIN_B1
- VITAMIN_B2
- VITAMIN_B3
- VITAMIN_B5
- VITAMIN_B6
- VITAMIN_B12
- VITAMIN_C
- VITAMIN_E
- VITAMIN_K

## Constraints
1. OrderNumbers are between 1 and 3, and have to be unique
2. The nutrient section has to contain at least 1 of the subsections *Macronutrients* or *Vitamins*
3. The vitamin section has to contain minimum 3 and a maximum 5 vitamins

## Complete Examples

### 1. Minimal Valid Recipe
```
Page {
    Instructions {
        orderNumber 1
    }
    Ingredients {
        orderNumber 2
    }
    Header {
        BasicInformation
        Title
    }
}
```

### 2. Full Featured Recipe
```
Page {
    Instructions {
        orderNumber 2
    }
    Ingredients {
        orderNumber 1
        UnitOfMeasureToggle
    }
    Header {
        BasicInformation
        Title
        Image
    }
    Nutrients {
        orderNumber 3
        PercentageAmountToggle
        Vitamins {
            vitamin {
                VITAMIN_A,
                VITAMIN_B12,
                VITAMIN_C,
                VITAMIN_D,
                VITAMIN_E
            }
        }
        Macronutrients
    }
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Missing Required Elements
   - Every Page must have Instructions, Ingredients, and Header sections
   - Instructions and Ingredients must have orderNumber
   - Header must have BasicInformation and Title

2. Incorrect Ordering
   - While the sections can appear in any order within the Page, each section's internal elements must follow the grammar structure

3. Vitamin Syntax
   - Vitamins must be specified within a vitamin block
   - Use commas to separate multiple vitamins
   - Only use predefined vitamin constants
